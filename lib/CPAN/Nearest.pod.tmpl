=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a way of searching for CPAN modules whose name
may be misspelt. For example, if a user accidentally types
"Lingua::Stopwords" when looking for the module "Lingua::StopWords",
the common cpan clients will not be able to function:

    cpan Lingua::Stopwords

gives

    Warning: Cannot install Lingua::Stopwords, don't know what it is.
    Try the command

    i /Lingua::Stopwords/

    to find objects with matching identifiers.

and

    cpanm Lingua::Stopwords

gives

    ! Finding Lingua::Stopwords on cpanmetadb failed.
    ! Finding Lingua::Stopwords on search.cpan.org failed.
    ! Finding Lingua::Stopwords () on mirror http://www.cpan.org failed.
    ! Couldn't find module or a distribution Lingua::Stopwords ()

CPAN::Nearest supplies a spelling-mistake tolerant search for the most
similar name, intended for people making tools like C<cpan>, C<cpanm>,
C<pm-uninstall>, and anything else which needs to use the CPAN
packages list. CPAN::Nearest was written to be fast enough for
practical use.

CPAN::Nearest was inspired by the helpful "git" version control
system, which provides suggestions for spelling mistakes.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 search

    my $close_name = search ($file, $module_name);

Search the package detail file C<$file> for a module named
C<$module_name> and return the closest name. For example, if you
search for "Harry::Potter":

[% example("harry-potter") %]

The file specified by the first argument, C<$file> in the example, is
usually found at F<~/.cpan/sources/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz>
on a Unix-like system. This may be specified as the file name. This
module can read either a compressed or uncompressed version. There is
a speed increase of 10-20% when an uncompressed file is used.

=head1 FILES

Users of the C<cpan> utility supplied with Perl may find the file
listing the CPAN modules in
F<~/.cpan/sources/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz>. Others can
download the file from the directory F</modules/> of any CPAN mirror. 

=head1 HISTORY

This module was the precursor of L<Text::Fuzzy> by the same author
(Ben Bullock). All of the search functionality of CPAN::Nearest was
moved to Text::Fuzzy and the XS parts of the module removed in version
0.13. The standalone C program was also removed from the distribution
in version 0.13, and its documentation was deleted in version 0.14.
